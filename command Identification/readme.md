# Command Identification

## Simple and Compound Commands

* Simple Commands is a list of words separated by spaces and terminated by either a  newline or one of the other control operators

* The first word of a simple command is interpreted as command name and the following words are interpreted as arguments to that command

* Compound Commands give bash its programming constructs

* The shell uses a list of reserved words to deter where compound commands start and end
